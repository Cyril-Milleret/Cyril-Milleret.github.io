My name is Cyril Milleret. I am a researcher at the university of Norwegian life sciences ([NMBU](https://www.nmbu.no/en), Norway)
and at the [CEFE-CNRS](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/en/) at Montpellier (France). 
I first studied forestry and nature management/conservation,
but then decided to enroll into research after developing an interest in trying to make sense of data. 

With my colleagues, we mostly develop and apply statistical methods to estimate population size, density,
demographic parameters of wildlife populations. However, I am interested in a large range of questions and problems.
In this website, you will find an overview of my work.
